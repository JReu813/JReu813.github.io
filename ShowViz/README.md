<h1>Welcome to ShowViz!</h1>
<h2>An exploration of Broadway since 2020, through data.</h2>

We're Neha Kalra, Jared Reuben, and Mohamed Mohamed, and we're super excited to present our final project, ShowViz, to you. 
We began this project because many of us are interested in theatre, and we wanted to learn more about the ways in which Broadway, given it is one of the most notable examples of which in the world, has changed as an industry in recent years. We knew the pandemic shook the performing arts when it hit in 2020, but we did not know how to quantify that, or what the magnitude of the impact looked like. Now, we're looking forward to sharing what we found.

We used fullPage.js for the layout of our website. Interacting with this interface is quite simple-- all a user needs to do is scroll downward, or click the bubbles on the right-hand side to navigate directly to their page of choice. Then, while on visualization pages, they should follow the instructions given in the corresponding text.

To make our work possible, we used Leaflet, Bootstrap, the noUiSlider, fullPage.js, and wNumb.js. Other than libraries associated with them, the rest of the files are based on labs/homeworks we've done in class thus far, or they are entirely our own.
